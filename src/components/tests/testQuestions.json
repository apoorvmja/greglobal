Two provinces in particular, Satsuma and Choshu, launched rebellions protesting the Shogunate’s acceptance of the unfavorable terms. Already weakened by an increasingly indebted samurai bureaucracy and faltering political power, the Shogunate was unable to quell the revolution and was forced to capitulate. Guided by ideals of equality among all Japanese, one of the first reforms was the abolition of the class system that was the hallmark of Shogunate rule. Under the Shogunate system, most of Japan’s population was sorted into one of four rigidly defined hereditary classes, with the samurai, or warriors, as the highest, ruling class. Below the samurai ranked the farmers, followed by artisans, followed by the merchants, the lowest caste. In an almost unprecedented move, the leaders of the Satsuma and Choshu rebellions, after reinstating the Emperor to supreme power, renounced their samurai status, opening up the entirety of the Japanese population to military service. Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. What can be inferred from the passage? The emperor of Japan had no power under Tokugawa governance.

Accordingly, phenomenological criticism asserted that a more immediate, visceral experience could be conveyed by suspending the 'haze of secondary associations' that often mediates between the audience and the performance object. Critics of this approach have pointed out that Husserl and other phenomenologists naively thought that language was a transparent system that reflected reality, though this belief has been strongly discredited by linguists and deconstructionist philosophers.

In response to this criticism, theater and performance scholars have adapted their methodology, citing later phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose work focuses on the importance of the body in forming consciousness, and disavowing the reductive formulations of Husserl.",

            "passage": "Although the first major and systematic defense of women’s rights appeared as early as 1792 with Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Woman, it would be almost a century before the theme of women’s equality with men was seriously entertained as a result of John Stuart Mill’s The Subjection of Women (1869). Wollstonecraft argued that women appeared different from men in moral character largely due to the deficient opportunities afforded them and the social expectation that they concern themselves with frivolity. She emphasized the importance of educating women consistent with their role as educators and caretakers of children, yet fell short of clearly defending a statement of the equality of the sexes, sometimes seeming to grant a natural superiority to men. In Mill’s work, the belief that women are by nature inferior to men was subjected to a powerful demand for empirical evidence. Echoing Wollstonecraft, he recognized that women appear inferior due to the differential social constraints acting on the sexes, and insisted that equality must be instituted in practice before women’s nature may be seen clearly enough to allow a fair comparison to men’s. He excoriated the then popular notion that social inequality was needed to safeguard the natural roles of women as caretakers and child bearers. No law, he noted, is needed to prevent women from doing what they naturally cannot but do, and if it is indeed in the best interest of society to have women serve as caretakers, such positions must be made appealing enough to be worth holding.",

Wollstonecraft argued that women appeared different from men in moral character largely due to the deficient opportunities afforded them and the social expectation that they concern themselves with frivolity. She emphasized the importance of educating women consistent with their role as educators and caretakers of children, yet fell short of clearly defending a statement of the equality of the sexes, sometimes seeming to grant a natural superiority to men. In Mill’s work, the belief that women are by nature inferior to men was subjected to a powerful demand for empirical evidence. Echoing Wollstonecraft, he recognized that women appear inferior due to the differential social constraints acting on the sexes, and insisted that equality must be instituted in practice before women’s nature may be seen clearly enough to allow a fair comparison to men’s. He excoriated the then popular notion that social inequality was needed to safeguard the natural roles of women as caretakers and child bearers. No law, he noted, is needed to prevent women from doing what they naturally cannot but do, and if it is indeed in the best interest of society to have women serve as caretakers, such positions must be made appealing enough to be worth holding.",
