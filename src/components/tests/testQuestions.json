Already weakened by an increasingly indebted samurai bureaucracy and faltering political power, the Shogunate was unable to quell the revolution and was forced to capitulate.

These scholars found that phenomenology allowed them to describe their encounters with the performance event in a way unencumbered by the language-centered critical modes of psychoanalysis and deconstruction. Accordingly, phenomenological criticism asserted that a more immediate, visceral experience could be conveyed by suspending the 'haze of secondary associations' that often mediates between the audience and the performance object. Critics of this approach have pointed out that Husserl and other phenomenologists naively thought that language was a transparent system that reflected reality, though this belief has been strongly discredited by linguists and deconstructionist philosophers. This means, they argue, that even if phenomenology gives access to an encounter with the 'essence' of a given art object, this encounter could never be conveyed to others in speech or writing without distortion or filtration of meaning. In response to this criticism, theater and performance scholars have adapted their methodology, citing later phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose work focuses on the importance of the body in forming consciousness, and disavowing the reductive formulations of Husserl.",

Wollstonecraft argued that women appeared different from men in moral character largely due to the deficient opportunities afforded them and the social expectation that they concern themselves with frivolity. She emphasized the importance of educating women consistent with their role as educators and caretakers of children, yet fell short of clearly defending a statement of the equality of the sexes, sometimes seeming to grant a natural superiority to men. In Mill’s work, the belief that women are by nature inferior to men was subjected to a powerful demand for empirical evidence. Echoing Wollstonecraft, he recognized that women appear inferior due to the differential social constraints acting on the sexes, and insisted that equality must be instituted in practice before women’s nature may be seen clearly enough to allow a fair comparison to men’s. He excoriated the then popular notion that social inequality was needed to safeguard the natural roles of women as caretakers and child bearers. No law, he noted, is needed to prevent women from doing what they naturally cannot but do, and if it is indeed in the best interest of society to have women serve as caretakers, such positions must be made appealing enough to be worth holding.",

To evaluate the argument it must be determined whether these savings will compensate for the increased cost. Thus, study of the expected reduction in the need for further hospital stays is needed, and choice C is the best answer. The argument requires no study of the ratio between surgery and recovery time, so choice A is inappropriate. Past and future changes in cost are irrelevant to evaluating an argument that is based on the currently projected cost, so choices B and E are inappropriate. Finally, since studying the care with which the custom replacements are made does not itself provide information about costs, choice D is also incorrect."

Since the conclusion acknowledges the difference between the number of civilian and armed forces deaths, expressing this difference as a percentage, as suggested by B, is beside the point.

D provides corroborative evidence for the latter explanation by suggesting that, for many former teachers, poor pay and working conditions were reasons for their quitting the profession. Therefore, D is the best answer. A, C, and E provide evidence that tends to implicate new hiring standards in the staffing shortage and thus support the explanation that the passage rejects.

Option (C) is incorrect because it was Scott Joplin and James Scott who explored the relations between Black music and continental folk music and not the above-mentioned people."

            "passage": "The determination of the sources of copper ore used in the manufacture of copper and bronze artifacts of Bronze Age civilizations would add greatly to our knowledge of cultural contacts and trade in that era. Researchers have analyzed artifacts and ores for their concentrations of elements, but for a variety of reasons, these studies have generally failed to provide evidence of the sources of the copper used in the objects. Elemental composition can vary within the same copper-ore lode, usually because of varying admixtures of other elements, especially iron, lead, zinc, and arsenic. And high concentrations of cobalt or zinc, noticed in some artifacts, appear in a variety of copper-ore sources. Moreover, the processing of ores introduced poorly controlled changes in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the resulting metal. Some elements evaporate during smelting and roasting; different temperatures and processes produce different degrees of loss. Finally, flux, which is sometimes added during smelting to remove waste material from the ore, could add quantities of elements to the final product.",
            "questionText": "According to the passage, possible sources of the lead found in a copper or bronze artifact include which of the following?",

              "The copper ore used to manufacture the artifact",
              "Flux added during processing of the copper ore",

              "The copper ore used to manufacture the artifact",
              "Flux added during processing of the copper ore",
              "Other metal added during processing of the copper ore"
            ],
            "explanation": "According to the passage, one of the sources of lead which is found in the artifacts made of copper or bronze is the copper ore which contains lead in its impure state. Copper ore is processed to extract the pure form of copper devoid of all the impurities which are present in its ore. However, sometimes lead which is present in the ore as an impurity does not separate from the ore after processing and remains a part of the metal. The artifacts made up of this copper definitely have the presence of lead. Thus, option (A) applies to the answer. Flux is a substance which is added during the smelting of the copper ore to remove impurities from the ore and is a part of the process of processing of the ore to derive a pure form of copper. The adding of flux sometimes has its own disadvantages because instead of removing impurities during the process of smelting it could add impurities to copper. Lead could be one of the impurities added to copper by flux and find space in the final product. This copper with lead concentration when used to make artifacts has lead in them. Thus, option (B) applies to the answer. Other metal added during the processing of the copper ore could have some amount of lead in it which would lead to the presence of lead in the final pure copper. Thus, artifacts made up of this copper will have lead in them. Thus, option (C) applies to the answer."

Whereas related groups of organisms take on widely different characteristics in becoming adapted to unlike environments in the case of adaptive divergence, we find that unrelated groups of organisms exhibit adaptive convergence when they adopt similar modes of life or become suited for special sorts of environments. For example, invertebrate marine animals living firmly attached to the sea bottom or to some foreign object tend to develop a sub cylindrical or conical form. This is illustrated by coral individuals, by many sponges, and even by the diminutive tubes of bryozoans. Adaptive convergence in taking this coral-like form is shown by some brachiopods and pelecypods that grew in fixed position. More readily appreciated is the streamlined fitness of most fishes for moving swiftly through water; they have no neck, the contour of the body is smoothly curved so as to give minimum resistance, and the chief propelling organ is a powerful tail fin. The fact that some fossil reptiles (ichthyosaurs) and modern mammals (whales, dolphins) are wholly fishlike in form is an expression of adaptive convergence, for these air-breathing reptiles and mammals, which are highly efficient swimmers, are not closely related to fishes.

Option (A) is incorrect because it only talks about 'modern mammalian life forms that are aquatic.' However, the passage states that ichthyosaurs are fossil reptiles and not mammals.

However, we cannot infer from the passage that ichthyosaurs and dolphins have greater mobility than brachiopods. This is because the passage does not talk about the mobility of brachiopods at all. Hence, option (B) cannot be correct."
