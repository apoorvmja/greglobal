Already weakened by an increasingly indebted samurai bureaucracy and faltering political power, the Shogunate was unable to quell the revolution and was forced to capitulate.

These scholars found that phenomenology allowed them to describe their encounters with the performance event in a way unencumbered by the language-centered critical modes of psychoanalysis and deconstruction. Accordingly, phenomenological criticism asserted that a more immediate, visceral experience could be conveyed by suspending the 'haze of secondary associations' that often mediates between the audience and the performance object. Critics of this approach have pointed out that Husserl and other phenomenologists naively thought that language was a transparent system that reflected reality, though this belief has been strongly discredited by linguists and deconstructionist philosophers. This means, they argue, that even if phenomenology gives access to an encounter with the 'essence' of a given art object, this encounter could never be conveyed to others in speech or writing without distortion or filtration of meaning. In response to this criticism, theater and performance scholars have adapted their methodology, citing later phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose work focuses on the importance of the body in forming consciousness, and disavowing the reductive formulations of Husserl.",

Wollstonecraft argued that women appeared different from men in moral character largely due to the deficient opportunities afforded them and the social expectation that they concern themselves with frivolity. She emphasized the importance of educating women consistent with their role as educators and caretakers of children, yet fell short of clearly defending a statement of the equality of the sexes, sometimes seeming to grant a natural superiority to men. In Mill’s work, the belief that women are by nature inferior to men was subjected to a powerful demand for empirical evidence. Echoing Wollstonecraft, he recognized that women appear inferior due to the differential social constraints acting on the sexes, and insisted that equality must be instituted in practice before women’s nature may be seen clearly enough to allow a fair comparison to men’s. He excoriated the then popular notion that social inequality was needed to safeguard the natural roles of women as caretakers and child bearers. No law, he noted, is needed to prevent women from doing what they naturally cannot but do, and if it is indeed in the best interest of society to have women serve as caretakers, such positions must be made appealing enough to be worth holding.",

To evaluate the argument it must be determined whether these savings will compensate for the increased cost. Thus, study of the expected reduction in the need for further hospital stays is needed, and choice C is the best answer. The argument requires no study of the ratio between surgery and recovery time, so choice A is inappropriate. Past and future changes in cost are irrelevant to evaluating an argument that is based on the currently projected cost, so choices B and E are inappropriate. Finally, since studying the care with which the custom replacements are made does not itself provide information about costs, choice D is also incorrect."

Since the conclusion acknowledges the difference between the number of civilian and armed forces deaths, expressing this difference as a percentage, as suggested by B, is beside the point.

D provides corroborative evidence for the latter explanation by suggesting that, for many former teachers, poor pay and working conditions were reasons for their quitting the profession. Therefore, D is the best answer. A, C, and E provide evidence that tends to implicate new hiring standards in the staffing shortage and thus support the explanation that the passage rejects.

Option (C) is incorrect because it was Scott Joplin and James Scott who explored the relations between Black music and continental folk music and not the above-mentioned people."

            "passage": "The determination of the sources of copper ore used in the manufacture of copper and bronze artifacts of Bronze Age civilizations would add greatly to our knowledge of cultural contacts and trade in that era. Researchers have analyzed artifacts and ores for their concentrations of elements, but for a variety of reasons, these studies have generally failed to provide evidence of the sources of the copper used in the objects. Elemental composition can vary within the same copper-ore lode, usually because of varying admixtures of other elements, especially iron, lead, zinc, and arsenic. And high concentrations of cobalt or zinc, noticed in some artifacts, appear in a variety of copper-ore sources. Moreover, the processing of ores introduced poorly controlled changes in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the resulting metal. Some elements evaporate during smelting and roasting; different temperatures and processes produce different degrees of loss. Finally, flux, which is sometimes added during smelting to remove waste material from the ore, could add quantities of elements to the final product.",
            "questionText": "According to the passage, possible sources of the lead found in a copper or bronze artifact include which of the following?",

              "The copper ore used to manufacture the artifact",
              "Flux added during processing of the copper ore",

              "The copper ore used to manufacture the artifact",
              "Flux added during processing of the copper ore",
              "Other metal added during processing of the copper ore"
            ],
            "explanation": "According to the passage, one of the sources of lead which is found in the artifacts made of copper or bronze is the copper ore which contains lead in its impure state. Copper ore is processed to extract the pure form of copper devoid of all the impurities which are present in its ore. However, sometimes lead which is present in the ore as an impurity does not separate from the ore after processing and remains a part of the metal. The artifacts made up of this copper definitely have the presence of lead. Thus, option (A) applies to the answer. Flux is a substance which is added during the smelting of the copper ore to remove impurities from the ore and is a part of the process of processing of the ore to derive a pure form of copper. The adding of flux sometimes has its own disadvantages because instead of removing impurities during the process of smelting it could add impurities to copper. Lead could be one of the impurities added to copper by flux and find space in the final product. This copper with lead concentration when used to make artifacts has lead in them. Thus, option (B) applies to the answer. Other metal added during the processing of the copper ore could have some amount of lead in it which would lead to the presence of lead in the final pure copper. Thus, artifacts made up of this copper will have lead in them. Thus, option (C) applies to the answer."

Whereas related groups of organisms take on widely different characteristics in becoming adapted to unlike environments in the case of adaptive divergence, we find that unrelated groups of organisms exhibit adaptive convergence when they adopt similar modes of life or become suited for special sorts of environments. For example, invertebrate marine animals living firmly attached to the sea bottom or to some foreign object tend to develop a sub cylindrical or conical form. This is illustrated by coral individuals, by many sponges, and even by the diminutive tubes of bryozoans. Adaptive convergence in taking this coral-like form is shown by some brachiopods and pelecypods that grew in fixed position. More readily appreciated is the streamlined fitness of most fishes for moving swiftly through water; they have no neck, the contour of the body is smoothly curved so as to give minimum resistance, and the chief propelling organ is a powerful tail fin. The fact that some fossil reptiles (ichthyosaurs) and modern mammals (whales, dolphins) are wholly fishlike in form is an expression of adaptive convergence, for these air-breathing reptiles and mammals, which are highly efficient swimmers, are not closely related to fishes.

Option (A) is incorrect because it only talks about 'modern mammalian life forms that are aquatic.' However, the passage states that ichthyosaurs are fossil reptiles and not mammals.

However, we cannot infer from the passage that ichthyosaurs and dolphins have greater mobility than brachiopods. This is because the passage does not talk about the mobility of brachiopods at all. Hence, option (B) cannot be correct."

It is now becoming clear that, contrary to Mill’s theory, women have had a literature of their own all along. The women novelist, according to Vineta Colby, was 'really neither single nor anomalous,' but she was also more than a 'register and spokesman for her age.' She was part of a tradition that had its origins before her age, and has carried on through our own. Many literary historians have begun to reinterpret and revise the study of women writers. Ellen Moers sees women’s literature as an international movement, 'apart from, but hardly subordinate to the mainstream: an undercurrent, rapid and powerful.' This 'movement' began in the late eighteenth century, was multinational, and produced some of the greatest literary works of two centuries, as well as most of the lucrative pot-boilers.' Patricia Meyer Spacks, in The Female Imagination, finds that 'for readily discernible historical reasons women have characteristically concerned themselves with matters more or less peripheral to male concerns, or at least slightly skewed from them. The differences between traditional female preoccupations and roles and male ones make a difference in female writing.' Many other critics are beginning to agree that when we look at women writers collectively we can see an imaginative continuum, the recurrence of certain patterns, themes, problems, and images from generation to generation.",

The women novelist, according to Vineta Colby, was \"really neither single nor anomalous,\" but she was also more than a \"register and spokesman for her age.\" She was part of a tradition that had its origins before her age, and has carried on through our own.\n\nMany literary historians have begun to reinterpret and revise the study of women writers. Ellen Moers sees women's literature as an international movement, \"apart from, but hardly subordinate to the mainstream: an undercurrent, rapid and powerful.\" This 'movement' began in the late eighteenth century, was multinational, and produced some of the greatest literary works of two centuries, as well as most of the lucrative pot-boilers.\" Patricia Meyer Spacks, in The Female Imagination, finds that \"for readily discernible historical reasons women have characteristically concerned themselves with matters more or less peripheral to male concerns, or at least slightly skewed from them. The differences between traditional female preoccupations and roles and male ones make a difference in female writing.\" Many other critics are beginning to agree that when we look at women writers collectively we can see an imaginative continuum, the recurrence of certain patterns, themes, problems, and images from generation to generation.",

Option (A) stands incorrect because at the women’s conference held at Seneca Falls, it was not the culmination of the Utopian Socialist Movement which took place but of the feminist ideas which were popularized by the socialized movement in Europe over a period of two decades.

This clearly weakens the above argument. Option (A) strengthens the argument because it only states that more regular shoppers live in central Georgia. It does not explain the relationship with the relocation of the mall. Option (C) strengthens the given argument because it explains the positive impact of relocating the mall. Option (D) pertains to those shoppers who use private or public transport to access the mall. However, the given argument is about those shoppers who walk to the mall. So, this option has no impact on the given argument. Option (E) also has no impact on the argument because it suggests that relocation of the mall will have no impact on the shopping habits of the shoppers."

Consequently, B is the best answer. A is not a supported inference, since there is no information to suggest that larger households are not more likely to have either more purchasing power or lower food and shelter expenses. C and D are not supported, since the passage compares only households that share the same income level. Because the relative amounts spent on different types of expenditures are not specified for any of the categories of households, E is not supported."

They have demonstrated, however, that a variety of the complex molecules currently making up living organisms could have been present in the early ocean and atmosphere, with only one limitation: such molecules are synthesized far less readily when oxygen-containing compounds dominate the atmosphere. Therefore some scientists postulate that the Earth's earliest atmosphere, unlike that of today, was dominated by hydrogen, methane, and ammonia. From these studies, scientists have concluded that the surface of the primitive Earth was covered with oceans containing the molecules fundamental to life. Although, at present, scientists cannot explain how these relatively small molecules combined to produce larger, more complex molecules, some scientists have precipitously ventured hypotheses that attempt to explain the development, from larger molecules, of the earliest self-duplicating organisms.",

            ],
            "explanation": "The answer is (B). The main point of the argument is the relocation of the mall so that it is more accessible to shoppers who walk to the mall. Option (B) suggests that the number of shoppers in Surrey is smaller than the number of shoppers in Georgia. So, if the mall is relocated to central Surrey, it will reduce the number of shoppers. This clearly weakens the above argument. Option (A) strengthens the argument because it only states that more regular shoppers live in central Georgia. It does not explain the relationship with the relocation of the mall. Option (C) strengthens the given argument because it explains the positive impact of relocating the mall. Option (D) pertains to those shoppers who use private or public transport to access the mall. However, the given argument is about those shoppers who walk to the mall. So, this option has no impact on the given argument. Option (E) also has no impact on the argument because it suggests that relocation of the mall will have no impact on the shopping habits of the shoppers."

A, D, and E all describe factors relevant to costs, but there is no reason to think that the situation described in the passage will cause the costs resulting from these factors to increase.

Other theorists propose that the Moon was ripped out of the Earth’s rocky mantle by the Earth’s collision with another large celestial body after much of the Earth’s iron fell to its core. One problem with the collision hypothesis is the question of how a satellite formed in this way could have settled into the nearly circular orbit that the Moon has today.
